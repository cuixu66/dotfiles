# HISTSIZE     --> number of lines of command to store in history "list" (memory)
# HISTFILESIZE --> number of lines of command to store in history "file"
# The history "file" is not updated as you type the commands.
# The commands get stored in a "list" separately (accessed by the history command).
# The number of these stored commands is controlled by HISTSIZE  value.
# When the shell (interactive) exits, the last  $HISTSIZE  lines are copied/appended to  $HISTFILE  from that "list".
# If  HISTFILESIZE  is set, then after this operation, it is ensured that only  $HISTFILESIZE  lines (latest) exist in  $HISTFILE .
# And when the shell starts, the "list" is initialized from  $HISTFILE  upto a maximum of  $HISTSIZE  commands.
