#change the hardstatus settings to give an window list at the bottom of the
##screen, with the time and date and with the current window highlighted                  
hardstatus             alwayslastline
# The following hardstatus is useless, and just kept here for future reference
#hardstatus string '%{= mK}%-Lw%{= KW}%50>%n%f* %t%{= mK}%+Lw%< %{= kG}%-=%D %d %M %Y %c:%s%{-}'
# The next line is commented out because byobu takes care of the status bar configuration for me
# if I use screen alone, I should uncomment the next line
#hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %d/%m %{W}%c %{g}]'
